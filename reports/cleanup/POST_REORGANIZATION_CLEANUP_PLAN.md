# üßπ Post-Reorganization Cleanup Plan

## Files Identified for Cleanup

### 1. **Backup Files** (Safe to Remove)
- `/Users/sanjeevadodlapati/Downloads/Repos/ChemML/quick_access_demo.py.backup`
- `/Users/sanjeevadodlapati/Downloads/Repos/ChemML/src/models/quantum_ml/quantum_circuits.py.backup`
- `/Users/sanjeevadodlapati/Downloads/Repos/ChemML/src/drug_design/admet_prediction.py.backup`
- `/Users/sanjeevadodlapati/Downloads/Repos/ChemML/src/models/classical_ml/regression_models.py.backup`

### 2. **Legacy src_backup Directory** (Safe to Remove)
- `/Users/sanjeevadodlapati/Downloads/Repos/ChemML/src_backup/` (entire directory)
  - This was created during migration and is no longer needed
  - All content has been properly migrated

### 3. **Test Result Files** (Safe to Remove)
- `/Users/sanjeevadodlapati/Downloads/Repos/ChemML/day6_day7_test_results.json`
  - Temporary test output file

### 4. **Development Files in tools/** (Organize/Keep)
- These are utility scripts that should be kept but are properly organized

### 5. **Archive Directory** (Keep - Contains Important Backups)
- `/Users/sanjeevadodlapati/Downloads/Repos/ChemML/archive/`
  - Contains the original monster file backups
  - **KEEP** - Important for rollback capability

## Cleanup Actions

### ‚úÖ Safe to Remove:
1. All `.backup` files (scattered backup files)
2. `src_backup/` directory (legacy backup from migration)
3. `day6_day7_test_results.json` (temporary test output)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep (Important):
1. `archive/` directory (contains original monster file backups)
2. All files in `tools/` (organized utilities)
3. All files in `tests/` (test suite)
4. All files in `scripts/` (organized scripts)

## Estimated Space Savings: ~50MB+
## Risk Level: Low (only removing confirmed temporary/backup files)
