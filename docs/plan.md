# ChemML Project Plan

## Project Overview
ChemML is a repository aimed at exploring machine learning and quantum computing techniques for molecular modeling and drug design. The project will leverage existing libraries such as DeepChem and RDKit to facilitate the development of algorithms for molecular data processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Goals
1. **Data Processing**: Develop robust methods for cleaning and preparing molecular data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Implement techniques to extract meaningful features from molecular datasets.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Classical Machine Learning: Create regression models for property prediction.
   - Quantum Machine Learning: Design quantum circuits for advanced modeling tasks.
4. **Drug Design**: Innovate algorithms for molecular generation and property prediction.
5. **Visualization and Metrics**: Provide tools for visualizing results and evaluating model performance.

## Milestones
- **Week 1**: 
  - Set up the project structure and environment.
  - Complete data processing and feature extraction modules.
- **Week 2**: 
  - Implement classical machine learning models.
  - Begin development of quantum machine learning components.
- **Week 3**: 
  - Focus on drug design algorithms.
  - Start creating Jupyter notebooks for tutorials and experiments.
- **Week 4**: 
  - Finalize model implementations and testing.
  - Prepare documentation and API reference.

## Tentative Structure/Organization
- **src**: Contains the main source code organized into subdirectories for data processing, models, drug design, and utilities.
- **data**: Holds raw and processed molecular data files.
- **notebooks**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for tutorials and experimental work.
- **tests**: Contains unit tests to ensure the reliability of the code.
- **docs**: Provides project documentation, including the project plan and API reference.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists necessary Python libraries.
- **setup.py**: Manages project packaging and dependencies.
- **README.md**: Offers an overview and instructions for using the project.

## Conclusion
The ChemML project aims to bridge the gap between machine learning and quantum computing in the field of molecular modeling and drug design. By following this plan, we will systematically develop the necessary components and ensure a structured approach to achieving our goals.
