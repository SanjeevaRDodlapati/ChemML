### 📊 Quick Assessment (Weekly)

**Rate yourself (1-5 scale):**

- Technical Skills Progress: ___/5
- Project Implementation: ___/5
- Research Understanding: ___/5
- Professional Development: ___/5
- **Weekly Average: ___/5**

**If average < 3:** Review resources, adjust pace, seek help
**If average ≥ 4:** Consider accelerating or adding challenges
