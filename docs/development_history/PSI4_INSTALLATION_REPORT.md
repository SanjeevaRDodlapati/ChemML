# Psi4 Installation Analysis and Solutions

## Summary of Findings

After thorough investigation, we've identified several key issues regarding Psi4 installation for your system:

1. **Pip Installation Issue**: Psi4 is not available via pip for macOS with Python 3.11. It's primarily distributed via conda channels.

2. **Conda Issues**: Your current conda installation (version 24.11.3) has a problem with a missing library `libarchive.19.dylib` which prevents it from functioning properly.

3. **Available Solutions**: There are viable options for installing Psi4, including using Miniforge (a cleaner conda distribution) or Docker.

## Detailed Installation Options

### Option 1: Install Miniforge (Recommended)

Miniforge is a minimal conda distribution that comes with conda-forge as the default channel. This is the most reliable method for scientific packages on macOS.

```bash
# Download Miniforge installer
curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

# Install Miniforge
bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniforge3

# Add Miniforge to your PATH (for zsh)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/miniforge3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Create a dedicated environment for Psi4
mamba create -n psi4env python=3.8 -y
mamba activate psi4env

# Install Psi4 and other required packages
mamba install -c conda-forge psi4=1.9.1 numpy pandas matplotlib rdkit ase pyscf deepchem -y
```

### Option 2: Use Docker

If Miniforge installation doesn't work or you prefer isolated environments, Docker is a great option:

```bash
# Install Docker Desktop for Mac from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

# Pull the Psi4 image
docker pull psi4/psi4:latest

# Run a container with your current directory mounted
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/work -w /work psi4/psi4:latest
```

For Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/work -w /work -p 8888:8888 psi4/psi4:latest jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

### Option 3: Fix Existing Conda

If you prefer to fix your existing conda installation:

```bash
# Install libarchive
brew install libarchive

# Create a symlink to the brew-installed libarchive
sudo ln -s $(brew --prefix libarchive)/lib/libarchive.19.dylib /usr/local/lib/

# Then create a conda environment for Psi4
conda create -n psi4env python=3.8 -y
conda activate psi4env
conda install -c conda-forge psi4 -y
```

## Continue Without Psi4

The notebook has been designed with fallbacks for when Psi4 is not available. These include:
- Mock implementations of Psi4 functionality for demonstration purposes
- Alternative approaches using other quantum chemistry packages like PySCF

## Verification

After installation with any method, verify your Psi4 installation with:

```python
import psi4
print(f"Psi4 version: {psi4.__version__}")

# Simple test calculation
psi4.set_memory('500 MB')
h2 = psi4.geometry("""
0 1
H
H 1 0.9
""")
psi4.set_output_file('h2_test.txt')
energy = psi4.energy('scf/cc-pvdz')
print(f"H2 energy: {energy}")
```
