# Psi4 Installation Investigation: Final Report

## Executive Summary

After a thorough investigation into the Psi4 installation issues for the day_04 quantum chemistry notebook, we have identified the root causes and provided several viable solutions. The inability to install Psi4 via pip is expected behavior as Psi4 is primarily distributed via conda channels, especially for macOS systems.

## Key Findings

1. **Pip Installation Failure**:
   - Psi4 is not available through pip for macOS with Python 3.11
   - This is by design - Psi4 is primarily distributed through conda channels

2. **Conda Issues**:
   - The current conda installation (24.11.3) has a missing library dependency (`libarchive.19.dylib`)
   - This prevents conda commands from working correctly

3. **Available Solutions**:
   - Multiple viable paths exist to install Psi4
   - Miniforge provides the most reliable approach for macOS
   - Docker offers an isolated, pre-configured environment

## Recommended Solutions (In Order of Preference)

### 1. Miniforge Installation (Most Reliable for macOS)

Miniforge is a minimal conda distribution with conda-forge as the default channel, avoiding many common issues with the full Anaconda distribution:

```bash
# Download Miniforge installer
curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

# Install Miniforge
bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniforge3

# Add to PATH
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/miniforge3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Create environment and install Psi4
mamba create -n psi4env python=3.8 -y
mamba activate psi4env
mamba install -c conda-forge psi4=1.9.1 numpy pandas matplotlib rdkit ase pyscf -y
```

### 2. Docker-Based Solution (Most Isolated)

Docker provides a completely isolated environment with Psi4 pre-installed:

```bash
# Install Docker Desktop first
# From: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

# Pull the official Psi4 image
docker pull psi4/psi4:latest

# Run with current directory mounted
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/work -w /work psi4/psi4:latest

# For Jupyter Notebook access
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/work -w /work -p 8888:8888 psi4/psi4:latest jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

### 3. Fix Existing Conda Installation

If you prefer to use your existing conda installation:

```bash
# Install libarchive with Homebrew
brew install libarchive

# Create symlink to the brew-installed library
sudo ln -s $(brew --prefix libarchive)/lib/libarchive.19.dylib /usr/local/lib/

# Create environment and install Psi4
conda create -n psi4env python=3.8 -y
conda activate psi4env
conda install -c conda-forge psi4 -y
```

## Verification

We've created a verification script (`verify_psi4.py`) that checks if Psi4 is correctly installed and functional. After installing Psi4 with any of the methods above, run:

```bash
python verify_psi4.py
```

## Fallback Mechanism

The notebook has been designed with fallback mechanisms for when Psi4 is not available:

1. Mock implementations of Psi4 functionality for demonstration purposes
2. Alternative approaches using other quantum chemistry packages like PySCF

These allow users to follow along with the notebook even without Psi4 installed.

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation has been updated to reflect our findings:

1. Day 04 notebook with comprehensive installation guidance
2. Created `PSI4_INSTALLATION_REPORT.md` with detailed analysis
3. Added verification script for testing successful installations
