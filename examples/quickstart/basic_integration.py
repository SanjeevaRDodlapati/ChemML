"""
Basic QeMLflow Integration Example
===============================

This is the simplest possible example showing how to use QeMLflow's
integration framework. Perfect for beginners getting started.

What this example shows:
- How to import QeMLflow integrations
- How to get the integration manager
- How to check available models
- How to create a basic adapter
- How to make a simple prediction

Prerequisites:
- QeMLflow installed (pip install qemlflow)
- Basic Python knowledge

Expected runtime: < 30 seconds
