**Key Capabilities:**
```python
# Automatic performance tracking
with metrics.track_operation("model_name", "prediction", input_size=100):
    result = model.predict(data)

# Performance summaries
summary = metrics.get_model_performance_summary("boltz")
# Returns: success rate, avg duration, memory usage, performance trend

# System health monitoring
health = metrics.get_system_health()
# Returns: CPU/memory status, GPU utilization, system alerts
```

- **Test Report Generation**: Comprehensive test reports with recommendations and status summaries

**Key Capabilities:**
```python
# Quick adapter validation
test_result = quick_adapter_test(AdapterClass)
# Returns: "AdapterName: PASSED (5 passed, 0 failed)"

# Comprehensive testing
suite = create_adapter_test_suite()
results = suite.validate_adapter(AdapterClass)
# Returns: detailed test results with recommendations

# Custom test data
molecular_data = generate_molecular_test_data()
protein_data = generate_protein_test_data()
```

model = manager.integrate_from_github(
    repo_url="https://github.com/example/model.git",
    model_class="ExampleModel",
    validate_adapter=True  # Runs automated tests
)

# Get recommendations
recommendations = manager.get_model_recommendations(
