# ISSUE RESOLUTION: Day 3 Pandas Import Error Fixed

## Summary
✅ **RESOLVED**: Fixed the `NameError: name 'pd' is not defined` error in Day 3 molecular docking script.

## What was fixed
The Day 3 script (`day_03_molecular_docking_final.py`) was failing with:
```
NameError: name 'pd' is not defined
```

This occurred because the `analyze_docking_results` function tried to use `pd.DataFrame` before the pandas import/fallback logic was executed.

## Root cause
- Pandas import logic was inside the `main()` function
- Functions defined outside `main()` couldn't access the `pd` variable
- The `analyze_docking_results` function used `pd.DataFrame` at line 801 before setup

## Solution applied
1. **Moved pandas import to module level** (line ~50, before any function definitions)
2. **Enhanced fallback DataFrame** with missing methods:
   - `sort_values()` for sorting DataFrames
   - `head()` for getting first n rows
3. **Removed duplicate pandas logic** from main() function
4. **Added comprehensive error handling** in fallback implementations

## Testing performed
✅ Direct script execution test - Day 3 runs without errors
✅ Quick access demo integration test - Works properly
✅ Comprehensive verification - All tests pass

## Files modified
- `notebooks/quickstart_bootcamp/days/day_03/day_03_molecular_docking_final.py`

## Impact
- Day 3 script now works in environments without pandas
- Robust fallback system ensures compatibility
- Quick access demo system works properly with Day 3
- All bootcamp functionality is restored
