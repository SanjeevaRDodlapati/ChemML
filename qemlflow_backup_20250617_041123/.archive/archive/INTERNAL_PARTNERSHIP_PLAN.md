## **📋 Our Internal Testing Protocol**

### **Week 1: Core Validation**
**Days 1-2**: Technical Deep Dive
- I'll run comprehensive performance benchmarks
- You test basic import and usage patterns
- We identify any immediate issues

**Days 3-4**: Real Workflow Testing
- You try actual chemistry/ML workflows
- I monitor performance and errors
- We iterate on any problems found

**Days 5-7**: Edge Case & Stress Testing
- I test boundary conditions systematically
- You try unusual or complex scenarios
- We validate robustness together

### **Week 2: Polish & Finalization**
**Days 1-3**: Address Findings
- Fix any issues discovered in Week 1
- Optimize performance if needed
- Improve documentation based on usage

**Days 4-5**: Final Validation
- Re-run all tests after improvements
- Confirm production readiness
- Document final status

**Days 6-7**: Strategic Planning
- Decide on next steps based on results
- Plan any future expansion (if/when needed)
- Celebrate our success! 🎉
