## 💻 **Usage Guidelines**

### **Running Notebooks**
```bash
# Start Jupyter in the QeMLflow environment
cd notebooks/
jupyter lab

# Or run specific notebooks
jupyter notebook learning/fundamentals/01_basic_cheminformatics.ipynb
```

### **Prerequisites**
- **Environment:** QeMLflow conda environment active
- **Dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from project root
- **Data:** Some notebooks may download datasets automatically

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Import errors:** Ensure QeMLflow environment is activated
- **Missing data:** Check individual notebook instructions
- **Performance issues:** Some quantum notebooks require significant compute
