# üöÄ Day 1 Quick Start Guide

## Before You Begin

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Jupyter notebook environment (Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook)
- Basic Python knowledge recommended

### üîß Quick Setup (Optional)
```bash
# If using conda (recommended)
conda create -n chemml python=3.11
conda activate chemml

# Install essential packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn requests scikit-learn

# Optional: Install cheminformatics packages
pip install rdkit-pypi deepchem
```

**Note:** The notebook will run even without these packages thanks to built-in fallback systems!

## üéØ How to Use This Notebook

### 1. **Start Simple**
- Open the notebook in your preferred environment
- Run cells sequentially from top to bottom
- Don't worry about errors - the notebook handles them gracefully

### 2. **Interactive Learning**
- Follow the assessment prompts when they appear
- Enter your student ID when requested (or use demo mode)
- Choose your learning track: quick, standard, intensive, or extended

### 3. **Understand the Output**
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks = successful operations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warnings = using fallback systems (still educational!)
- ‚ùå Red errors = issues caught and handled (learning continues)

## üìã What to Expect

### Section 1: Environment & Molecular Representations (1 hour)
- **Goal:** Set up tools and understand molecular representations
- **Activities:** SMILES parsing, molecular visualization, descriptor calculation
- **Outcome:** Understand how molecules are represented for ML

### Section 2: DeepChem Fundamentals (1.5 hours)
- **Goal:** Master DeepChem for molecular ML
- **Activities:** Dataset loading, featurization, first ML models
- **Outcome:** Build and evaluate molecular property prediction models

### Section 3: Advanced Property Prediction (1.5 hours)
- **Goal:** Compare different ML approaches
- **Activities:** Multiple featurizers, Random Forest vs Deep Learning
- **Outcome:** Understand trade-offs between different modeling approaches

### Section 4: Data Curation (1 hour)
- **Goal:** Handle real-world chemical data
- **Activities:** Data cleaning, missing values, dataset integration
- **Outcome:** Master practical data preprocessing skills

### Section 5: Integration & Portfolio (1 hour)
- **Goal:** Consolidate learning and prepare for advanced topics
- **Activities:** Performance comparison, documentation, next steps
- **Outcome:** Complete Day 1 with portfolio documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Scenarios

#### "Assessment framework not found"
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Assessment framework not found. Using basic fallback system.
```
**Solution:** This is normal! The fallback system provides the same educational value.

#### "RDKit not found"
```
‚ùå RDKit not found. Installing...
```
**Solution:** The notebook will attempt automatic installation. If it fails, learning continues with demo data.

#### "DeepChem dataset loading failed"
```
‚ùå Error loading dataset: [error message]
üîÑ Creating demo dataset for learning purposes...
```
**Solution:** Demo datasets provide the same learning experience without network dependencies.

#### "Model creation failed"
```
‚ùå Model creation failed: [error message]
üí° This demonstrates the concept of graph neural networks for molecules
```
**Solution:** The notebook explains concepts even when models can't be created.

### Quick Fixes

#### Memory Issues
- Restart kernel: `Kernel ‚Üí Restart`
- Clear output: `Cell ‚Üí All Output ‚Üí Clear`
- Run cells individually rather than all at once

#### Network Issues
- Continue anyway - all network features have offline alternatives
- Demo data provides equivalent learning experience

#### Import Errors
- Don't worry! The notebook includes fallback systems
- All learning objectives remain achievable

## üìä Progress Tracking

### What Gets Tracked
- ‚úÖ **Concepts Mastered:** SMILES, descriptors, fingerprints, ML models
- ‚úÖ **Activities Completed:** Molecule analysis, model training, evaluation
- ‚úÖ **Time Spent:** Automatic timing for each section
- ‚úÖ **Performance:** Model accuracy, completion rates

### Assessment Types
- **Interactive Widgets:** Answer questions about concepts (when available)
- **Activity Recording:** Automatic tracking of completed exercises
- **Self-Assessment:** Reflect on understanding and code quality
- **Progress Reports:** Comprehensive summary at the end

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 1, you will:

1. **Parse and manipulate molecular structures** using SMILES representations
2. **Calculate molecular descriptors** for drug-likeness assessment
3. **Build ML models** for molecular property prediction
4. **Compare different approaches** (classical ML vs deep learning)
5. **Handle real-world chemical data** with proper curation workflows
6. **Evaluate model performance** using appropriate metrics
7. **Document your progress** for portfolio development

## üöÄ Next Steps

### After Completing Day 1
1. **Review your progress report** generated at the end
2. **Check Day 2 readiness** - the notebook will tell you if you're ready
3. **Install additional packages** if you want to explore further:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torch-geometric  # For Day 2
   ```

### Optional Extensions
- Explore additional molecular datasets
- Try different machine learning algorithms
- Investigate molecular descriptor variations
- Practice with your own chemical data

## üí° Tips for Success

### Time Management
- **Quick Track:** Focus on core concepts, skip deep dives
- **Standard Track:** Balance concepts with hands-on practice
- **Intensive Track:** Explore all features and extensions
- **Extended Track:** Maximum depth and experimentation

### Learning Strategy
1. **Read Before Running:** Understand what each cell does
2. **Experiment Safely:** The notebook handles errors gracefully
3. **Ask Questions:** Use the notes sections to capture thoughts
4. **Connect Concepts:** Link molecular representations to ML performance

### Getting Help
- Read error messages carefully - they often contain solutions
- Check the troubleshooting section above
- Use the assessment framework to track areas needing review
- Review previous sections if concepts aren't clear

## üéâ Ready to Start!

You now have everything needed to successfully complete Day 1 of the ChemML bootcamp. The notebook is designed to be forgiving and educational, so jump in and start learning!

**Remember:** The goal is learning, not perfect execution. The robust error handling ensures you'll have a great educational experience regardless of technical issues.
