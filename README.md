## Overview

ChemML focuses on leveraging machine learning and quantum computing to enhance molecular modeling and drug discovery processes. The project includes modules for data processing, classical and quantum machine learning models, drug design algorithms, and utilities for visualization and metrics evaluation.

## Installation

To set up the ChemML project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChemML.git
cd ChemML
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the various modules in the project. Here are some examples:

1. **Data Processing**: Use the `molecular_preprocessing.py` and `feature_extraction.py` scripts to clean and prepare your molecular data.
2. **Model Training**: Implement classical machine learning models using `regression_models.py` or explore quantum machine learning with `quantum_circuits.py`.
3. **Drug Design**: Generate new molecular structures with `molecular_generation.py` and predict properties using `property_prediction.py`.
4. **Visualization**: Utilize the functions in `visualization.py` to visualize your data and model results.
