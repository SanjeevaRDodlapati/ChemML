## 📝 Implementation Notes

### **Issues Encountered**
- Terminal command quoting issues with complex shell commands
- Solution: Use simpler, individual commands instead of complex chained commands

### **Decisions Made**
- Verified organized day scripts exist and work before removing duplicates
- Used progressive approach - one phase at a time with verification

### **Next Steps**
1. Remove remaining development artifacts
2. Create archive directory structure
3. Move development documentation to archive
